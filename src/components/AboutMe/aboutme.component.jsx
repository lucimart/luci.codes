            Born in Venezuela, I found that I loved two things, programming and
            design. I started studying Computer Science at{' '}

            finishing my degree.

            In Spain I became a self-taught learner. Bypassing the traditional
            education system, I decided to study via all the docs on the
            internet that I can have time to study, using platforms such as
            Udemy, Khan Academy, Skillshare, Coursera, Domestika and more.

            Since all of this, I've worked as a freelance graphic designer, and
            a freelance web dev. I have dealed with customers, and consider
            myself an independent and fast learner, but in my experience with
            collaborative programming and working, I put my heart on the
            following phrase "Together, we can go further"
